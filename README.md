Multiplatform Dart project with code sharing between Flutter and web

40% code sharing between Flutter and web. 
The Android & iOS apps are made with a single Flutter codebase. 
The web app is made with AngularDart. 
This project is generally something that I believe is a good example of a multiplatform Dart project.
